This is my first React-Native App. 

This app is being created as both a learning experience and as an in-kind donation to the Fairfax County Arts Council's InOut Springfield installation.

The app is being built with Expo and React-Navigation.  The app will take a user's responses to a set of survey questions and post the answers to a Mongo database.

After the data is posted to Mongo the app will open the IOS mobile device's camera and allow the user to take a selfie. 

From there the user is directed to a preview screen and if the user is happy with their picture the app will tweet the picture with a previously specified hashtag.


Currently we are having trouble with back-end deployment and with the tweet automation.
